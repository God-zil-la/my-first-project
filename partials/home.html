  <h2>So what are 3D Printing and 3D Scanning?</h2>
  <!-- Lista -->
  <p>
    <strong>3D Printing</strong> is a technology that creates three-dimensional
    objects by building up layers of material based on a digital model.<br />
    This enables rapid and customized manufacturing in various industries,
    including medicine, automotive, and design.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>3D Scanning</strong> is used to digitize physical objects by
    creating an accurate digital representation. It is often used in reverse
    engineering,<br />
    medical research, art conservation, and industrial applications.
