  <h2 id="home-what-title">So what are 3D Printing and 3D Scanning?</h2>

  <p id="home-printing-description">
    <strong>3D Printing</strong> is a technology that creates three-dimensional
    objects by building up layers of material based on a digital model.
    This enables rapid and customized manufacturing in various industries,
    including medicine, automotive, and design.
  </p>

  <p id="home-scanning-description">
    <strong>3D Scanning</strong> is used to digitize physical objects by
    creating an accurate digital representation. It is often used in reverse
    engineering, medical research, art conservation, and industrial applications.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling):</strong>
      <p id="fdm-desc">Melts and extrudes plastic filament layer by layer.</p>
