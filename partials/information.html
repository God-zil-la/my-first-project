    <h1 id="info-title">Workflow for “3D Scanned Object to 3D Printable File”</h1>
  
    <p id="info-workflow">
      When an object has been scanned, you get a mesh file, a shell of the scanned surface consisting of reference points that form triangles.
      The file is imported into the program, such as Fusion 360, where you need to review any missed data that can generate holes in the mesh,
      or direct errors in the depicted scan. There may also be unwanted scanned material from the environment that needs to be cleaned away.
      Once the file is repaired and the mesh is cleaned and intact, it is simply saved as a .stl file and imported into the slicer program.
      In the slicer program, you select the settings you want and save as a .gcode file. That file contains settings for the printer,
      such as temperature, speed, feed and coordinates in X-Y-Z directions that the printer then follows.

    <h2 id="info-scanner-diff-title">Differences between iPad, Artec and ATOS scanners</h2>
  
    <p id="info-ipad">
      We tested scanning with iPad, Artec Eva and Atos scanner, and functionally the scanning works in a similar way.
      You photograph the object from the sides you want to include. With an <strong>iPad or iPhone/Android</strong> phone
      you can now scan objects, and get a result that is suitable for simpler modeling, such as smaller sculptures,
      busts or things with less accuracy.
      <em>Area of use:</em> Most suitable for simpler images for e.g. home users or where the object is less detailed.

    <p id="info-artec">
      <strong>Artec Eva</strong> is a handheld scanner that delivers very good results with an accuracy of up to 0.1mm,
      and is suitable for medium to large objects. You scan the object by moving the scanner over or around it until all surfaces are scanned.
      The scanner takes pictures continuously and you have to try to scan quickly but at the same time get all angles, which requires practice.
      Because the scanner is constantly collecting data in the images, the files can become very heavy if you are too slow.
      <em>Area of use:</em> Professional use: virtual 3D models, art, design, healthcare, and reverse engineering.
    </p>
  
    <p id="info-atos">
      <strong>Atos</strong> scanner differs from previous scanners in that the scanner is mounted and you spin the object and take a
      still image/scan and then rotate the object and take a new image and repeat until you cover all angles.
      It can also be mounted on a robot. It has high accuracy, up to 0.02mm.
      <em>Area of use:</em> Reverse engineering, inspections/analyses, measurement and controls.

    <h2 id="info-comparison-title">Comparison of scanned object (stl) with CAD file (stl or stp)</h2>
  
    <p id="info-comparison">
      A scanned file contains measurement points from the scanned object, these form triangles like a net (mesh).
      It has no actual surface or volume, only coordinate references. The detail level depends on point density and triangle size.
      A CAD file forms a solid model and has full volume and references, allowing complete data extraction.

    <p id="info-gom">
      In a measurement program, such as GOM Inspect, you can import both the scanned geometry and the original CAD file.
      You can combine both geometries and measure deviations and possible defects in the manufactured part.
      This helps ensure precision in production and quality control.
