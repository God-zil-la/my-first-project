### Local Deployment:
1. **Download or Clone the Repository:**
   - Use Git to clone the repository:
   ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-printing-website.git
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Open the Project Files:**
   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Open `index.html` in a browser to test locally.

3. **Ensure File Linking:**
   - Make sure the `index.css` and `script.js` files are correctly linked in `index.html`.
   - Check that images are in the appropriate directory.

4. **Run a Local Server (Optional):**
   - You can start a simple local web server for testing:
     ```sh
     python3 -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.

### Web Deployment:
The website can be deployed using various hosting platforms like **GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel**.

#### **Deploying on GitHub Pages:**
1. Push the project to a GitHub repository:

   git push origin main
   ```
2. Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
3. Scroll to the **GitHub Pages** section and select the `main` branch as the source.
4. The site will be hosted at `https://yourusername.github.io/3d-printing-website/`.

#### **Deploying on Netlify:**
1. Sign in to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and click **New site from Git**.
2. Select your GitHub repository and configure build settings (no build command required for a static site).
3. Click **Deploy**, and Netlify will assign a public URL.

#### **Deploying on Vercel:**
1. Sign in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and create a new project.
2. Import the GitHub repository.
3. Configure deployment settings and click **Deploy**.
4. The project will be live with a Vercel-assigned URL or a custom domain.
